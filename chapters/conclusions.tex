\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{chap:conclusions}

The open data promises are still far from being materialised.
However, it cannot be denied that significant advances have been made in recent years.
In this section, the conclusions of this thesis will be derived, based on the initial hypothesis and in other findings that were made during this work.

In the Introduction of this work, two hypothesis were posed, which, for the ease of reading, are reproduced here:

\noindent\textbf{H\ref{hyp:tagging}:} Enhancing the organization of open data repositories leads to better use of open data;

\noindent\textbf{H\ref{hyp:dataliteracy}:} Increasing the level of data literacy on the society leads to better use of open data (which in turn motivates better publishing).

Regarding H\ref{hyp:tagging}, in the previous chapter results shown that system developed helped people in finding the more datasets quicker than using traditional approaches.
